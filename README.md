# CollegeChecklist
COMP 426 Web Application

Checklist for high school students applying to college 

This site was made for Best College Aid to have a login portal for their clients. 
In the portal, the clients (high school students) can create a to-do checklist for the colleges they're applying to and all the tasks they need to complete for their applications.

This application is based in React and uses Google Firebase APIs such as Authentication.
